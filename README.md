# Pulse of Exploration (mini)

I love [Dan Goods' art installation at JPL "Pulse of Exploration"](https://vimeo.com/93420747)

I love [cool light displays](https://starmaid.github.io/projects/hallie-lights)

This pulls data from [JPL Eyes DSN.](https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html)

This project uses [Adafruit CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/overview)

WS2812 light strips and [their python library from adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/python-usage)
